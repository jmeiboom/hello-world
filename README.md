# hello-world
This repository is an idea space

Hello, my name is Justin. I am learning Python. I am a Chef and am intrested in building programs related to the food service industry.
I also like learning about computer languages and programing. I hope I will be able to contribute to this community.
I would like to use this repository to store hair brained ideas I have, and to discuss them with others if they are interested.

Thank you :)
